Wireframes are simple black and white layouts that outline the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas and navigation for your website. The first step of any good design is to sketch out your ideas and determine the placement of all the different elements on a page. You may use a paper based wireframing or an online tools that make wireframing quick and easy.
